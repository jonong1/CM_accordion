### Coding Challenge
You're building an interactive editorial piece about national parks, and want to include an accordion component that will allow the reader to learn more about a different park.

Create a simple, minimalist accordion based on the video example and copy deck provided. Match the design as closely as you can. HTML should be as semantic as possible. The drawers should animate open and close (more than one drawer can be opened at a time) and the expand/collapse UI element should indicate the appropriate state. There’s also an “Expand All” button that will open all drawers when clicked. The inner text should then change to “Collapse All” and the new functionality will collapse all drawers when clicked. The button text should also change to “Collapse All” when all drawers are opened individually.

* Code should be optimized for Safari. Support for other browsers is not necessary.
Please limit library usage (no React, Vue, jQuery, etc). ES6 and CSS as much as possible. SASS is permissible.
* You will have 24 hours to complete the exercise.
